	// ### Creating the stream
	// Define the stream configuration, specifying `InterestPolicy` for retention, and
	// create the stream.
	cfg := jetstream.StreamConfig{
		Name:      "EVENTS",
		Retention: jetstream.InterestPolicy,
		Subjects:  []string{"events.>"},
	}

	// JetStream API uses context for timeouts and cancellation.
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	stream, _ := js.CreateStream(ctx, cfg)
	fmt.Println("created the stream")

	// To demonstrate the base case behavior of the stream without any consumers, we
	// will publish a few messages to the stream.

	// Checking out the stream info, notice how zero messages are present in
	// the stream, but the `last_seq` is 3 which matches the last ack'ed
	// publish sequence above. Also notice that the `first_seq` is one greater
	// which behaves as a sentinel value indicating the stream is empty. This
	// sequence has not been assigned to a message yet, but can be interpreted
	// as _no messages available_ in this context.
	fmt.Println("# Stream info without any consumers")
	printStreamState(ctx, stream)

	// ### Adding a consumer
	// Now let's add a pull consumer and publish a few
	// more messages. Also note that we are _only_ creating the consumer and
	// have not yet started consuming the messages. This is only to point out
	// that it is not _required_ to be actively consuming messages to show
	// _interest_, but it is the presence of a consumer which the stream cares
	// about to determine retention of messages. [pull]:
	// /examples/jetstream/pull-consumer/go
	cons, _ := stream.CreateOrUpdateConsumer(ctx, jetstream.ConsumerConfig{
		Durable:   "processor-1",
		AckPolicy: jetstream.AckExplicitPolicy,

	js.Publish(ctx, "events.input_focused", nil)

	// If we inspect the stream info again, we will notice a few differences.
	// It shows two messages (which we expect) and the first and last sequences
	// corresponding to the two messages we just published. We also see that
	// the `consumer_count` is now one.

	// the _next_ sequence number like in the base case.
	// ‚òùÔ∏è As a quick aside on that second ack, We are using `AckSync` here for this
	// example to ensure the stream state has been synced up for this subsequent
	// retrieval.
	fmt.Println("\n# Stream info with one consumer and acked messages")

	// ### Two or more consumers

	// that if messages were processed by one consumer, but not the other, the messages
	// would be retained. This is indeed the case.

	// Here we fetch 2 messages for `processor-2`. There are two observations to
	// make here. First the fetched messages are the latest two messages that
	// were published just above and not any prior messages since these were
	// already deleted from the stream. This should be apparent now, but this
	// reinforces that a _late_ consumer cannot retroactively show interest. The
	// second point is that the stream info shows that the latest two messages
	// are still present in the stream. This is also expected since the first
	// consumer had not yet processed them.
	msgs, _ = cons2.Fetch(2)

	// A final callout is that _interest_ respects the `FilterSubject` on a consumer.
	// For example, if a consumer defines a filter only for `events.mouse_clicked` events
	// then it won't be considered _interested_ in events such as `events.input_focused`.
