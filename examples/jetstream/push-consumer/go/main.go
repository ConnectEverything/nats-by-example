	fmt.Println(err)

	// Another nuance of implicitly creating a durable using this helper
	// method is that if `Unsubscribe` or `Drain` is called, the consumer
	// will actually be deleted. So these helpers should only be used
	// if neither of those methods are called.
	// A more explicit and (in my opinion) safer way to create durables
	// is using `js.AddConsumer`.
	// For push consumers, we must provide a `DeliverSubject` which is the
	// subject messages will be published to for a subscription to receive
	// them. We will also use a different durable name...

	// Now there are few ways we can setup a subscription. The two most
	// straightforward ways are using `nats.Bind` which handles looking
	// up the consumer and creating a core NATS subscription with the
	// `DeliverSubject`
	sub, _ = js.SubscribeSync("", nats.Bind(streamName, consumerName))

	// Since we created the durable explicitly, we can freely unsubscribe
	// and re-subscribe without the consumer being deleted.
	sub.Unsubscribe()

	// The second way to subscribe is directly to the `DeliverSubject` with
	// a core NATS subscription.
	sub, _ = js.SubscribeSync("", nats.Bind(streamName, consumerName))

	// ðŸ˜¨ Well, not yet. This is an area where people get tripped up with
	// push consumers. As note above, messages will be pushed to the
	// subscription *proactively*. These are expected to be handled, but
	// if they are not (in the case of us unsubscribing early only after
	// handling one message), those messages are not effectively in limbo
	// until the `MaxAck` timeout is reached. By default this is 30 seconds
	// for consumers requiring an explicit ack.
	// So we are not waiting for 30 seconds, I had explicity set the
	// `MaxAck` option in the consumer config above to shorter time so
	// we can simulate and observe the redelivery.
	time.Sleep(time.Second)

	// Now that the ack timeout has been reached, the server will redeliver
	// to this new active subscription. We can see this by checking the
	// pending messages again.
	queuedMsgs, queuedBytes, _ = sub.Pending()
