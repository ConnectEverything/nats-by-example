title: Queue Push Consumers (legacy)
description: |-
  A queue push consumer is analogous to a [core NATS queue group][qg], but
  designed to work with streams. Unlike a standard [push consumer][pc] which
  only supports a single bound subscription at any time, a queue-based one
  supports multiple subscriptions bound to the consumer. Messages from the
  consumer will be distributed randomly among active subscribers which can
  freely come and go.

  In this example, we will demonstrate how to create a durable
  queue push consumer and how to bind subscriptions to receive and process
  messages.

  Note that as of NATS server v2.8.4, *ephemeral* queue push consumers are not
  supported. This means that the server does not currently keep track of these
  and will auto-cleanup if no active subscriptions are bound. You can, of course,
  create a durable and then delete once you are done with it, but if the deletion
  fails to happen (program crashes), you will need to be sure to check when
  the starts up again.

  *It is recommended to review the standard [push consumer][pc] example in
  order to understand the general concepts. The queue-based variant is a
  small extension to this type of consumer.*
