title: Request-Reply
description: |-
  The [request-reply][reqrep] pattern allows a client to send a message and
  expect a reply of some kind. In practice, the request message will either
  be a *command*, which is an intention for service to carry out some work
  that results in a state change, or a *query*, which is a request for
  information.

  Unlike request-reply constrained protocols like HTTP, NATS is not limited
  to a strict point-to-point interaction between a client and server. The
  request-reply pattern is built on top of the core [publish-subscribe][pubsub]
  model.

  By default, this means that any one of subscribers could be a _responder_
  and reply to the client. However, because NATS is not limited to point-to-point
  interactions, the client could indicate to NATS that multiple replies should
  be allowed.

  This example shows the basics of the request-reply pattern including the
  standard "no responders" error if there are no subscribers available to
  handle and reply to the requesting message.
