	// In addition to vanilla publish-request, NATS supports request-reply
	// interactions as well. Under the covers, this is just an optimized
	// pair of publish-subscribe operations.
	// The _request handler_ is just a subscription that _responds_ to a message
	// sent to it. This kind of subscription is called a _service_.
	// For this example, we can use the built-in asynchronous
	// subscription in the Go SDK.

		// Parse out the second token in the subject (everything after greet.)
		// and use it as part of the response message.
		name := msg.Subject[6:]
		msg.Respond([]byte("hello, " + name))
	})

	// Now we can use the built-in `Request` method to do the service request.
	// We simply pass a nil body since that is being used right now. In addition,
	// we need to specify a timeout since with a request we are _waiting_ for the
	// reply and we likely don't want to wait forever.

	rep, _ = nc.Request("greet.bob", nil, time.Second)
	fmt.Println(string(rep.Data))

	// What happens if the service is _unavailable_? We can simulate this by
	// unsubscribing our handler from above. Now if we make a request, we will
	// expect an error.
	sub.Unsubscribe()
