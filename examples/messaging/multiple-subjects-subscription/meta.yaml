title: Iterating Over Multiple Subscriptions
description: |-
  Core NATS subscription support flexible subject model with tokens and wildcards, 
  but there are cases that require setting up separate subscriptions
  (i.e. user want `transport.cars`, `transport.planes` and `transport.ships`, but not `transport.spaceships`). 

  Such approach works and is performant, but not very convenient when reading the messages.
  This example shows how to achieve required behaviour without sacrificing usability.
